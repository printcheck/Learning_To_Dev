# Learning_To_Dev(Mostly c++/c) 
Different resources and cheatsheets for C++. These are added as I need them on my coding journey.
Feel free to add and help as you may see I'm early on my journy.
Any type of code is welcome but try to keep it c++ unless generic  and common and usefull.
I started emmebeded but enjoy the journy that Game engines bring me really want more algo type 
code to learn.


Any suggestions where this repository should go is welcome and apprciated
